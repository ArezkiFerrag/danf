Danf Documentation
==================

[←](../README.md)

Danf is a javascript/node full-stack framework providing many features in order to produce an scalable, maintainable, testable and performant code:
* An object-oriented programming layer.
* An inversion of control design (dependency injection via configurations files).
* A simple system allowing to use the same code on both client-side and server-side.
* A homogeneous way to handle all kind of events (http request, dom events, ...).
* An elegant solution to callback hell preserving asynchronicity.
* A helper to develop performant ajax applications supporting deep linking.
* A modular approach to develop and use (open source) modules.
* Some other helpful sub features to easily manage cookies, session, ...

Understand
----------

Let's understand the main [concepts](concepts.md) that guided the developement of Danf.

Learn
-----

You have 4 possible axes to learn more things about Danf (the best way is certainly to follow the order if you are a beginner):

* [Observe the framework](observe/index.md): take a quick look of how to code with the framework thanks to some small and uplifting examples.
* [Test the framework](test/index.md): apply it to a concrete application.
* [Use the framework](use/index.md): consult the use documentation.
* [Customize the framework](customize/index.md): make your own framework.

Each section of Test has a related section in Use and each section of Customize belongs to one of these sections. Thus, you can easily navigate inside axes and/or inside sections.

Contribute
----------

Danf is a young framework. You can help to make it better! Fork it on github and feel free to improve it.

You can also contribute without working on the framework itself. In Danf, all your code is always automatically part of a **danf module**. This way you can then easily share your modules with other people using npm. You can find a list of existing **danf modules** [here](modules.md).

Another nice way to help is to correct and/or to improve this documentation (is it really English?)!
