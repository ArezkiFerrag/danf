Understand

Let's understand the main [concepts](concepts.md) that guided the developement of [Danf](../README.md).

Learn
-----

You have 4 possible axes to learn more things about Danf (the best way is certainly to follow the order if you are a beginner):

* [Observe the framework](observe/index.md): take a quick look of how to code with the framework thanks to some small and uplifting examples.
* [Test the framework](test/index.md): apply it to a concrete application.
* [Use the framework](use/index.md): consult the use documentation.
* [Customize the framework](customize/index.md): make your own framework.

Each section of Test has a related section in Use and each section of Customize belongs to one of these sections. Thus, you can easily navigate inside axes and/or inside sections.
